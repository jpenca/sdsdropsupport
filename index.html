<p>Using SDS Drop is easy. Just drag&nbsp;an audio sample to one of the pads. The app will transfer the sample to your Rytm, load&nbsp;it to your active project, and make changes to your current kit so that the sample is ready to use immediately.</p>
<p>If you drag multiple samples, they will be loaded to the project, but not linked into your kit.</p>
<p>SDS Drop gives you a few additional options for sample transfers.</p>
