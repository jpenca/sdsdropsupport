<h2>Using SDS Drop</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="sdsdropmain.png" alt="SDS Drop Main Window" width="592" height="530" /></p>
<p>Using SDS Drop is easy. Just drag&nbsp;an audio sample to one of the pads. The app will transfer the sample to your Rytm, load&nbsp;it to your active project, and make changes to your current kit so that the sample is ready to use immediately.</p>
<p>If you drag multiple samples, they will be loaded to the project, but not linked into your kit.</p>
<p>SDS Drop gives you a few additional options for sample transfers.</p>
<h2>Connecting your Rytm</h2>
<p>Connect your Rytm Drum Computer to your Mac using a USB cable.</p>
<h2>Transfer Options</h2>
<h3>SMP</h3>
<p>If this&nbsp;option is enabled, the&nbsp;new sample will be loaded to the&nbsp;current kit's selected track, and the&nbsp;sample volume will be set to maximum, so that you can instantly&nbsp;use the new sample.</p>
<h3>SYN</h3>
<p>If this is enabled, the analog synth of the selected track will be disabled. If you want to hear only your sample in that track, enable this!</p>
<h3>PRJ</h3>
<p>This option selects whether samples will be loaded to the current project. This only affects batch transfers (when you drag multiple samples to the app). If you drag a sample to a pad, and SMP is enabled, the sample is always loaded to the project so that it can be loaded into a track.</p>
